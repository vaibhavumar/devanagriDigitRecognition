# Handwritten-Devanagari-Numerals-Recognition-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network is implemented in keras for MultiClass Classification of Handwritten Devanagari Numerals.

Single prediction is also implemented that is, user can give the appropriate path to a Devanagari numeral image and the corresponding value will become 1 in the final result with an accuracy of 98.6%.
